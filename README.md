# Carroll-Triangle-Problem
This program was created to corroborate results related to a discrete version of Lewis Carroll's triangle problem, which asks the probability of three random points on a plane forming an obtuse triangle. 
The program loops through points on an established grid size, creating all possible sets of three points. Each point is assigned a coordinate, and the cosine of each angle in a set of three points is used to classify each set of three points as an acute, obtuse, or right triangle, or a non-triangle. 
Then the program counts and returns the number of triangles of each type. 
The program can also plot the percentage of obtuse triangles on a graph with respect to the horizontal length of the grid, approximately showing the limit of the probability for a given height as the grid grows horizontally.
